# todoList01
A set of todo lists with a clock and caender.

This Todo list has a few div elements containing a clock, calender, and three check lists,
labeled by time frame needed to get each task done. 
I find this useful for laying out my day and completeing
tasks in a timely manner.
Each div element has a box class associated with it
to change size and appearence in CSS. 
I formatted the layout using a css grid
and learned to use grid-column: 1 / -1;.

I would like to implement grid-row: 2 / 4;
but the layout worked smoother as is. 

Note:
Resizing is not set up!

How to use the code:
Open the folder in VS code, ensure CSS and Javscript are properly linked
in the html file!
open a live server.
